# KMP vs Brute Force Pattern Matching
 This program tests the performance of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt and brute force string searching algorithms, 	both algorithms need to match a 14 character pattern that only occurs at the end of text files containing DNA sequences of different lengths (1 million, 10 million and 20 million). The results are saved to an svg file.
