# KMP vs Brute Force Pattern Matching
 This program tests the performance of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt and brute force string searching algorithms, 	both algorithms need to match a 14 character pattern that only occurs at the end of text files containing, 	DNA sequences of different lengths ( 1 million, 10 million and 20 million). The results are saved to a svg file.
